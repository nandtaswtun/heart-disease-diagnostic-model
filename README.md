# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis
An interactive data science project using **Marimo** and **Scikit-Learn** to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical parameters.

## 🚀 Overview
This project explores a dataset of 270 patients to identify key indicators of heart disease. I implemented a Logistic Regression model that achieves **X% accuracy**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.12**
- **Marimo** (Reactive Notebooks)
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib** (Visualization)

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Cholesterol Levels:** Patients with heart disease showed an average cholesterol of `[Insert Value]`.
- **Model Performance:** The model shows high precision in identifying 'Presence' of disease, which is critical for medical screening.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install Marimo: `pip install marimo`
2. Run the notebook: `marimo edit analysis.py`
